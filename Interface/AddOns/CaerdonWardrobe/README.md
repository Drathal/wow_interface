# Caerdon Wardrobe

With Caerdon Wardrobe, you will gain the following:
* Show BOE / BOA on bank / bag / merchant items
* Add indicators showing unlearned wardrobe appearances to the following:
** Bank
** Bag
** Auctions
** Merchants
* Provides separate indicators for items specific to your class vs. something you'd need to send to and / or learn on an alt.

As with all Caerdon add-ons, this assumes and builds on top of the existing Blizzard functionality.  In this case, if you're replacing the bag, bank, merchant, or auction house views with another add-on, you will likely not receive the full functionality of this add-on.

Caerdon add-ons prefer simplicity over configuration.  There are currently no settings for this add-on.  I can consider adding them when it makes sense.
